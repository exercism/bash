# Word Count

Given a phrase, count the occurrences of each word in that phrase.

For example for the input `"olly olly in come free"`

```text
olly: 2
in: 1
come: 1
free: 1
```


Run the tests with:

```bash
bats word_count_test.sh
```

After the first test(s) pass, continue by commenting out or removing the `skip` annotations prepending other tests.## Source

This is a classic toy problem, but we were reminded of it by seeing it in the Go Tour.
