  # The above line controls whether to skip the test.
  # Normally, we skip every test except for the first one
  # (the first one is always commented out).  This allows for
  # a person to focus on solving a test at a time: you can
  # comment out or delete the
  # `[[ $BATS_RUN_SKIPPED == true  ]] || skip`
  # line to run the test when you are ready.
  #
  # You can also run the all the tests by setting the
  # `$BATS_RUN_SKIPPED` environment variable, like this:
  #
  #     $ BATS_RUN_SKIPPED=true bats two_fer_test.sh
