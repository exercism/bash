# Acronym

Convert a phrase to its acronym.

Techies love their TLA (Three Letter Acronyms)!

Help generate some jargon by writing a program that converts a long name like Portable Network Graphics to its acronym (PNG).

Run the tests with:

    bats whatever_test.sh

## Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `exercism/bash/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `bob.sh` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/bash/bob/bob.sh`.

For more detailed information about running tests, code style and linting, please see the [help page](http://exercism.io/languages/bash).
