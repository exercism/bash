# Error Handling

Implement various kinds of error handling and resource management.

An important point of programming is how to handle errors and close
resources even if errors occur.

This exercise requires you to handle various errors. Because error handling
is rather programming language specific you'll have to refer to the tests
for your track to see what's exactly required.


Run the tests with:

```bash
bats error_handling_test.sh
```

After the first test(s) pass, continue by commenting out or removing the `skip` annotations prepending other tests.



## POSIX compliance
On this track full POSIX compliance is not required. Therefore feel free to use any tool you need to complete
the exercises, like `sed`, `awk`, `date` or even `python`. As long as the solution is portable between systems
and does not require installing third party applications, it will be accepted.

However, once you have completed and submitted the exercise, take a second look at you solution.
Maybe the same results could be achieved in pure Bash, without using any external tools?

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.
