# Hello World

The classical introductory exercise. Just say "Hello, World!".

["Hello, World!"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program) is
the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language
or environment.

The objectives are simple:

- Write a function that returns the string "Hello, World!".
- Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.
- Submit your solution and check it at the website.

If everything goes well, you will be ready to fetch your first real exercise.

# Welcome to Bash!

Unlike many other languages here, bash is a bit of a special snowflake.
If you are on a Mac or other unix-y platform, you almost definitely
already have bash. In fact, anything you type into the terminal is
likely going through bash.

The downside to this is that there isn't much of a development
ecosystem around bash like there is for other languages, and there are
multiple verions of bash that can be frustratingly incompatible. Luckily
we shouldn't hit those differences for these basic examples, and if you
can get the tests to pass on your machine, we are doing great.

## Installation

As mentioned above, if you are on a unix-like OS (Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris,
etc), you probably already have bash.

## Testing

As there isn't much of a bash ecosystem, there also isn't really a de
facto leader in the bash testing area. For these examples we are using
[bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats). You should be able to
install it from your favorite package manager, on OS X with homebrew
this would look something like this:

```
$ brew install bats
==> Downloading
https://github.com/sstephenson/bats/archive/v0.4.0.tar.gz
==> Downloading from
https://codeload.github.com/sstephenson/bats/tar.gz/v0.4.0

üç∫  /opt/boxen/homebrew/Cellar/bats/0.4.0: 10 files, 60K, built in 2
seconds
```



Run the tests with:

```bash
bats hello_world_test.sh
```

After the first test(s) pass, continue by commenting out or removing the `skip` annotations prepending other tests.

This is an exercise to introduce users to using Exercism [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program)


## POSIX compliance
On this track full POSIX compliance is not required. Therefore feel free to use any tool you need to complete
the exercises, like `sed`, `awk`, `date` or even `python`. As long as the solution is portable between systems
and does not require installing third party applications, it will be accepted.

However, once you have completed and submitted the exercise, take a second look at you solution.
Maybe the same results could be achieved in pure Bash, without using any external tools?

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.
