# Welcome to Bash!

Unlike many other languages here, bash is a bit of a special snowflake.
If you are on a Mac or other unix-y platform, you almost definitely
already have bash. In fact, anything you type into the terminal is
likely going through bash.

The downside to this is that there isn't much of a development
ecosystem around bash like there is for other languages, and there are
multiple versions of bash that can be frustratingly incompatible. Luckily
we shouldn't hit those differences for these basic examples, and if you
can get the tests to pass on your machine, we are doing great.

## Installation

As mentioned above, if you are on a unix-like OS (Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris,
etc), you probably already have bash.

## Testing

As there isn't much of a bash ecosystem, there also isn't really a de
facto leader in the bash testing area. For these examples we are using
[bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats). You should be able to
install it from your favorite package manager, on OS X with homebrew
this would look something like this:

```
$ brew install bats
