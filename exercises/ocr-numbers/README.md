# OCR Numbers

Given a 3 x 4 grid of pipes, underscores, and spaces, determine which number is
represented, or whether it is garbled.

# Step One

To begin with, convert a simple binary font to a string containing 0 or 1.

The binary font uses pipes and underscores, four rows high and three columns wide.

```text
     _   #
    | |  # zero.
    |_|  #
         # the fourth row is always blank
```

Is converted to "0"

```text
         #
      |  # one.
      |  #
         # (blank fourth row)
```

Is converted to "1"

If the input is the correct size, but not recognizable, your program should return '?'

If the input is the incorrect size, your program should return an error.

# Step Two

Update your program to recognize multi-character binary strings, replacing garbled numbers with ?

# Step Three

Update your program to recognize all numbers 0 through 9, both individually and as part of a larger string.

```text
 _ 
 _|
|_ 
   
```

Is converted to "2"

```text
      _  _     _  _  _  _  _  _  #
    | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|| | # decimal numbers.
    ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _||_| #
                                 # fourth line is always blank
```

Is converted to "1234567890"

# Step Four

Update your program to handle multiple numbers, one per line. When converting several lines, join the lines with commas.

```text
    _  _ 
  | _| _|
  ||_  _|
         
    _  _ 
|_||_ |_ 
  | _||_|
         
 _  _  _ 
  ||_||_|
  ||_| _|
         
```

Is converted to "123,456,789"


Run the tests with:

```bash
bats ocr_numbers_test.sh
```

After the first test(s) pass, continue by commenting out or removing the
`[[ $BATS_RUN_SKIPPED == true ]] || skip` 
annotations prepending other tests.

To run all tests, including the ones with `skip` annotations, run:

```bash
BATS_RUN_SKIPPED=true bats ocr_numbers_test.sh
```

## External utilities
`Bash` is a language to write "scripts" -- programs that can call
external tools, such as
[`sed`](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/),
[`awk`](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/),
[`date`](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/date-invocation.html)
and even programs written in other programming languages, 
like [`Python`](https://www.python.org/).
This track does not restrict the usage of these utilities, and as long
as your solution is portable between systems and does not require
installation of third party applications, feel free to use them to solve
the exercise.

For an extra challenge, if you would like to have a better understanding
of the language, try to re-implement the solution in pure `Bash`,
without using any external tools. Note that there are some types of
problems that bash cannot solve, such as performing floating point
arithmetic and manipulating dates: for those, you must call out to an
external tool.

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others
have completed the exercise.
