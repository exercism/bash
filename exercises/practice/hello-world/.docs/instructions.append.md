## Welcome to Bash!

Unlike many other languages here, bash is a bit of a special snowflake.
If you are on a Mac or other unix-y platform, you almost definitely
already have bash. In fact, anything you type into the terminal is
likely going through bash.

The downside to this is that there isn't much of a development
ecosystem around bash like there is for other languages, and there are
multiple versions of bash that can be frustratingly incompatible. Luckily
we shouldn't hit those differences for these basic examples, and if you
can get the tests to pass on your machine, we are doing great.
