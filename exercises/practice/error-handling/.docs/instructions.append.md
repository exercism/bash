# Dummy header

## Bash-specific instructions

The goal of this exercise is to consider the number of arguments passed to your program.

Note that you can pass empty strings as arguments.

`./program ""`

This is different from passing no arguments at all.

`./program`

If your program is run with exactly one argument (even if it is an empty string), treat it as a person's name and print a greeting message.
If it is run with zero arguments or more than one argument, print an error message and exit with a non-zero status.
