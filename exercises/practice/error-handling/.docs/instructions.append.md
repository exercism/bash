# Dummy header

## Bash-specific instructions

The goal of this exercise is to consider the number of arguments passed to your program.

Note that you can pass empty strings as arguments:

`./program ""`

which is different from passing no arguments at all:

`./program`

In this excercise, if your program is run with exactly one argument (even if it is an empty string), treat is as a person's name and print a greeting message.

Otherwise if it is run with no arguments or more than one argument, print an error message and exit with a non-zero status.
