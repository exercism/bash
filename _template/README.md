# README 

**_TODO: this needs to be rewritten for exercism v3_**

In [my](https://github.com/glennj) experience, the simplest way to create a new exercise is to
(recursively) copy an existing exercise and systematically update each file.

<!--

All exercises should have a README.md file. This file should be generated using the `configlet` tool.

If a `hints.md` file has been added to an exericse, that exercise's `readme` needs to be regenerated. This is because the `hints.md` file will get appended to the `readme` when the `readme` is generated.

To generate the `readme` you need to:

1. Download [`configlet`](https://github.com/exercism/configlet/releases) and put it somewhere on your path (`configlet` is the tool we use to generate `readme` files).
2. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) the [problem-specifications](https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications) repository (this repo contains the template we use to generate `readme`s).
3. Run `configlet generate . --only exercise-slug --spec-path path_to_problem_specifications` from the root of this repository (exercism/bash).
