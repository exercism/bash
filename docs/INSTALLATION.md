Bash is usually found on any Linux, BSD, or Unix based systems. In the
graphical interface of your choice, look for an application named
"Terminal". Alternatively, Ctrl+Alt+F2 will take you to a shell login
(Ctrl+Alt+F1 or F7 to return to Graphical mode). 

To verify you are running a bash shell, enter the command 

    echo $BASH_VERSION

This should output some terse information about the version of
bash you are running. If it does not, run the command 

    /bin/bash


For Windows based Operating Systems, you may need to first install 
[Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/).  

For Apple OSX:
* open Finder,
* open your Applications folder, 
* open the Utilities folder, 
* finally open the `Terminal` application.
