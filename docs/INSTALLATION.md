Bash is usually found on any Linux, BSD, or Unix based systems.
In the graphical interface of your choice, look for an application named "Terminal".
Alternatively, Ctrl+Alt+F2 should take you to a shell login (Ctrl+Alt+F1 or F7 to return to Graphical mode).

To verify the version of Bash available, from the command line or terminal, run:

    echo $BASH_VERSION

If your shell is `bash` it should show something like:

    4.4.19(1)-release

You shouldn't need to do anything else, bash should be installed and in your path at this point, as it is your current shell.

If your shell isn't bash, there is no reason to change it.
You can write and run bash scripts without being in a bash shell.

To verify the version of bash installed, run:

```plain
bash --version
```

It will show something like this:

```
GNU bash, version 4.4.19(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

This should output some terse information about the version of bash you are running.
If it does not, you may not have bash installed.
You should install it using your distributions package manager.

For Windows, you may need to install [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). Alternatively, you can install [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/).

For Apple OSX:
* open Finder,
* open your Applications folder,
* open the Utilities folder,
* finally open the `Terminal` application.
