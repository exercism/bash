Bash is usually found on any Linux, BSD, or Unix based systems. In the graphical interface of your choice, look for an application named "Terminal". Alternatively, Ctrl+Alt+F2 will take you to a shell login (Ctrl+Alt+F1 or F7 to return to Graphical mode). To verify you have a bash shell, running the command "echo $SHELL" should return "/bin/bash". If it does not, run the command "/bin/bash".  

For Windows based Operating Systems, you may need to first install [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/).  

For Apple OSX, open your Applications folder, then open the Utilities folder, finally open the Terminal application.
