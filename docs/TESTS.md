As there isn't much of a bash ecosystem, there also isn't really a defacto leader in the bash testing area. For these examples we are using [bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats). You should be able to install it from your favorite package manager, on OS X with homebrew this would look something like this:

```
$ brew install bats
==> Downloading

https://codeload.github.com/sstephenson/bats/tar.gz/v0.4.0

```

```

```

For Red Hat, Scientific Linux, and CentOS 6 or later bats is found in the EPEL repository.
