Bash is a very powerful Unix shell and command scripting language. The man page for Bash is a well written and informational document. Additional guides, information, and examples can be found at the Linux Documentation Project. Shellcheck.net provides a web interface (and binary for some distros) that checks shell scripts for errors or common issues and provides information on how to best correct them.
