# Learning

Bash is a very powerful Unix shell and command scripting language, but it
does have a fairly steep learning curve. 

* The [man page](https://manpage.me/index.cgi?apropos=0&q=bash&sektion=1&manpath=Debian+7.8.0&arch=default&format=html)
  for Bash is a well written and informational document.  It is very "dense"
  though, and requires reading and re-reading.

* Additional guides, information, and examples can be found at 
    * [Greg's Wiki](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide),
    * the [Bash Hackers Wiki](https://web.archive.org/web/20230323071638/https://wiki.bash-hackers.org/),
    * the [bash tag info page](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/bash/info) on
      Stack Overflow,
    * and expanding on the man page, the [GNU Bash Manual](http://gnu.org/s/bash/manual)
      is _the_ source of information for bash.

* [shellcheck.net](https://www.shellcheck.net/) provides a web interface
  (and binary for some distros) that checks shell scripts for errors or
  common issues and provides information on how to best correct them.
